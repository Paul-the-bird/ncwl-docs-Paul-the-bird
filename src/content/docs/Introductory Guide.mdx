## Ships

:::caution
If you're reading this introductory guide, you should not buy your own ship. Your officers and fellow workers should have ships available for you to crew and train on.
:::

### Piloting

Interact with the Shuttle Console to bring up the piloting UI. Ensure your ship is undocked before you attempt to move it.

#### Modules

**Module** buttons, if available, can trigger a variety of ship systems such as weapons and blast doors. **Check the shipyard entry for your ship before interacting with these modules;** failure to do so may result in misfired weapons or other unintended consequences.

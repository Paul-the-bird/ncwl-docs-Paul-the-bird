## Ships

:::caution
If you're reading this introductory guide, you should (most likely) not buy your own ship. Your officers and fellow workers should have ships available for you to crew and train on.
:::

### Piloting

Interact with the Shuttle Console to bring up the piloting UI. Ensure your ship is undocked before you attempt to move it. Use WASD for forward/reverse/strafe, Q/E for rotation, and spacebar for brake.

#### Modules

**Module** buttons, if available, can trigger a variety of ship systems such as weapons and blast doors. **Check the shipyard entry for your ship before interacting with these modules;** failure to do so may result in misfired weapons or other unintended consequences.

### Weaponry

#### Mount Types

Hardpoints (or fixedpoints) are weapons built into your ship's hull. They cannot turn or rotate, but are generally more powerful than turrets.

Turrets can rotate to follow targets. **If turrets are armed, they will automatically fire on any ship belonging to a hostile faction.**

#### Weapon Types 

Ballistic weapons (such as machine guns and cannons) are most effective against hull.

Laser weapons pass through hull but do minimal structural damage and are intended to damage crew, except for plasma bolts which explode on the hull and spread radiation around the area.

Missiles create large explosions on impact, perfect for fighting large targets, but may have limited ammunition.


## Infantry Combat

For general SS14 combat mechanics, see [the wiki guide](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Combat) or [this explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35R3mMz21Q).


## Trading / Cargo Hauling

Various trade goods can be purchased at one station and then sold for a profit at other stations. Available trading partners vary depending on the NCWL's relationship with other factions.

1. Get a cargo hauler or any ship large enough to fit your desired number of **crates**.

2. Go to any station with a cargo hold. In the cargo department, locate a machine called the **dispensary**, where you can buy different types of cargo crates. Keep in mind each type of crate may be worth more or less to one station or another.

3. Once you have obtained your desired crates, go to a different station with a turn-in point. At the turn-in point, insert the crate (click the turn-in point using the same hand dragging the crate) and it will dispense a **deed**.

4. Go to a **deed console** to turn in the deeds for a credit chip of equivalent value. The station also receives a small amount of money as an incentive to promote trading. Deposit your credit chips at an ATM.

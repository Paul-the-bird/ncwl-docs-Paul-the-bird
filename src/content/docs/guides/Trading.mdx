Various trade goods can be purchased at one station and then sold for a profit at other stations. Available trading partners vary depending on the NCWL's relationship with other factions.

The value of trade goods tends to increase the farther you travel from their point of origin. Goods hauled to a nearby station will typically sell for less than goods hauled to a distant station.

## How-To

1. Get a cargo hauler or any ship large enough to fit your desired number of **crates**.

2. Go to any station with a cargo hold. In the cargo department, locate a machine called the **dispensary**, where you can buy different types of cargo crates. Keep in mind each type of crate may be worth more or less to one station or another.

3. Once you have obtained your desired crates, go to a different station with a turn-in point. At the turn-in point, insert the crate (click the turn-in point using the same hand dragging the crate) and it will dispense a **deed**.

4. Go to a **deed console** to turn in the deeds for a credit chip of equivalent value. The station also receives a small amount of money as an incentive to promote trading. Deposit your credit chips at an ATM.

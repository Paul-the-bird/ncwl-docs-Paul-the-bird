Various trade goods can be produced at space stations' Commodity Fabricators and then sold for a profit at other stations. Each station can produce unique goods from unique materials - some may be easier to come by than others. Available trading partners vary depending on the NCWL's relationship with other factions.

The value of trade goods tends to increase the farther you travel from their point of origin. Goods hauled to a nearby station will typically sell for less than goods hauled to a distant station.

## How-To

1. Find a **Commodity Fabricator** on a station, check what it can produce and what it needs for production.

2. Gather the **materials** - this may mean growing plants or salvaging wrecks - and insert them into the Fabricator.

3. Print as many **crates** as you want.

4. Get a **cargo hauler** or any ship large enough to fit your desired number of crates.

5. Once you have obtained your desired crates, go to a different station with a **Turn-in Chute**. At the Turn-in Chute insert the crate (click the chute using the same hand dragging the crate) and it will dispense a **deed**.

6. Go to a **Deed Console** to turn in the deeds for a credit chip of equivalent value. The station also receives a small amount of money as an incentive to promote trading. Deposit your credit chips at an ATM.

Most ammunition for ship weapons can be crafted at fabricators or microforges, while a few larger types (including 120mm, 320mm, Gargoyle missiles, and Lancer rockets) must be assembled using specialized "factory" machinery. 

Materials are loaded via conveyor belt into a **shell fabricator**. Missiles will be complete at this point, while artillery shells will continue down the conveyor belt to a **cartridge welding arm** and finally an **assembling arm**.

The conversion rates of materials to ammunition are listed below.

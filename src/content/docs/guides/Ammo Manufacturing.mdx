Most ammunition for ship weapons can be crafted at fabricators or microforges, while a few larger types (including 120mm, 320mm, Gargoyle missiles, and Lancer rockets) must be assembled using specialized "factory" machinery. 

Materials are loaded via conveyor belt into a **shell fabricator**. Missiles will be complete at this point, while artillery shells will continue down the conveyor belt to a **cartridge welding arm** and finally an **assembling arm**.

The conversion rates of materials to ammunition are as follows:

| Material    | Ammunition                                      |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| 5 Steel     | 120mm depleted uranium shell                    |
| 5 Uranium   | 120mm EMP artillery shell                       |
| 10 Plasma   | 120mm high-yield explosive artillery shell      |
| 10 Plasteel | 240mm heat-guided high-explosive cruise missile |
| 3 Plastic   | 100mm high-explosive fragmentation rocket       |

The front cover of the pamphlet is illustrated with a triumphal image of hardsuit-wearing insurgents (each of a different space-faring species) raising the torch of liberty in a field of stars, rifles slung over shoulders or carried loosely offhand. The title reads, simply: **PARTISAN**.

You flip it open to the first page.

> ***The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.***
> 
> *Partisan! The New Crescent Worker's League wages a tireless struggle against the tyranny of Empire and Capital.  Your future awaits, if only you would seize it: together, we will crush the chains that bind us in servitude.*

## Sector Crescent Gameplay

Gameplay in Sector Crescent diverges from that of most other Space Station 14 servers in a number of significant ways:

- **You belong to a faction and you should coordinate with them.** In most factions (including the NCWL), it's expected that you'll coordinate your activities with others and accept some guidance from leaders. However, unless you're purposely sabotaging your own faction without reason, any consequences for disobedience will likely be in-game punishment rather than admin intervention.

- **You can be killed by hostile factions at any time.** There are no rules for escalating levels of violence and hostile faction members can be killed on sight. There may be occasional exceptions to this but the possibility of imminent combat and death should be expected. *If you're not sure which factions are currently hostile to your own, ask someone in your faction.*

- **Gameplay is ship-focused.** Most (if not all) factions will start on a station as their base of operations, but ships are used for travel, combat, cargo hauling, mining, and most other activities.

## Refits

- Whenever possible, the **shuttle console**, **APC**, and other critical hardware should be relocated to whichever section of the ship will be farthest from enemy weapons. Typically this will be the rearmost section of the ship.

- Doors can be electrocuted (by cutting one power wire) to repel boarders as long as the crew have insulated gloves. Alternatively, they can be bolted using a remote signaler or button; use a multitool or network configurator to link the two.

- Hollow sections of the ship can be filled with reinforced walls. Consider removing unnecessary furniture to make room.

- Hardpoint weapons can be salvaged from other ships, re-attached to your own, and linked to your shuttle console with a multitool or network configurator. You can also salvage thrusters, certain generators and consoles, and most other ship equipment.

- Adding additional thrusters will improve your ship's acceleration and maneuverability, but not max speed (unless they're upgraded thrusters).

- Consider having a portable generator ready in case your ship's main power generation is damaged.


## Repairs

- If your shuttle console gets destroyed, your ship is dead. You may be able to use other consoles like the targeting computer, but you won't be able to fly anywhere.

- See the [Space Station 14 wiki's explanation of power systems](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power) to understand how generators, substations, and APCs are wired together and used to power other devices.

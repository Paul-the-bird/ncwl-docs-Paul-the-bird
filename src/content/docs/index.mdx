## New Crescent Worker's League

> *Stitched together from the still-warm corpses of many labor unions that were in disorganized rebellion against Imperial forces in the Feudal Era before the collapse of Bluespace lanes leading in and out of the Sector, the NCWL are the undisputed victors of the Crescent Revolution, holding four out of six systems within the Sector and ruling from their seat of power in the Core. Holding socialist ideals at heart, the NCWL aims to build a government by laborers, and for the people. Recently having launched a liberation campaign against the Taypan system in the Outer Rim, the League are finally throwing their hats in the pile to make their bid for the untamed frontier.*

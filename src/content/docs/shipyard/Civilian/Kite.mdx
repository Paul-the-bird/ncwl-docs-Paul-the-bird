> *A civilian all-rounder, the Kite is the first ship of many young, aspiring pilots. With FTL capabilities for expeditions, spacious cargo hold and dual plasmacaster armament, the Kite truly does it all for the first-timer.*


## Armaments

* 2x 400c plasma bolt repeater


## Modules

* Module A: Fire Plasmacasters


## Notes

A damaged variant of the Kite with vulcan cannons can be purchased at Freeport. There are one or more stealth combat ships that use the Kite hull and may resemble a Kite on radar; use caution if you encounter a Kite with no visible IFF signature.

;import ShipCost from '@components/ShipCost.astro';


> *A converted capital freighter, the Zhipov stands a testament to collective, organized desperation. An Imperial freighter is captured, the container gravlocks and internal cargo bays are stripped out, and a microforge capable of printing ultralight strikeshuttles are installed within the vessel, alongside docking ports to accompany them. Wire warship-grade auto-guided turrets onto the broadsides, and the end result is the Zhipov.*


## Armaments

* Turrets
  * 2 x 'Swarmer' autorocket pods 
  * 2 x 23mm automated ballistic turrets 
  * 6 x 'Gran Sudaruska' point defense turrets


## Modules

* Module A: Bridge Reinforcement 
* Module B: Open Portside Fighter Shutters 
* Module C: Open Starboard Fighter Shutters 
* Module D: Disarm Turrets 
* Module E: Rearm Turrets Techlevel


## Notes

Keep the Zhipov out of direct combat and use only as a mobile base for rearming fighters. The Zhipov should come with several thruster upgrade kits to be used on docked ultralights.

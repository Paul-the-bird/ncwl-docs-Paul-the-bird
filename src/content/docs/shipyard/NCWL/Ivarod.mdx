> *A steady mining barge converted into an overdriven light destroyer, the Ivarod's mining depth charges were ripped out in favor of the tried-and-tested Type-99 artillery hardpoints. Welded-on external gun mounts further allow for more offensive and defensive capability, with a steady spread of low-caliber point defense near the back and destructive rocket pods and autoguns near the front. Outfitted for long-term deployments, the Ivarod excels at sideliner and escort duty, assisting larger allies within a fleet, although it struggles on its own against larger targets.*

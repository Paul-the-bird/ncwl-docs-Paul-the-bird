    ## Pre-Flight Checklist

    1. Set generator output to the minimum level to keep all systems powered, to conserve fuel.
    2. Close the bolts on both slugthrowers. Optionally, first replace the ammunition in one slugthrower with EMP rounds.
    
    ## Refitting Options

    1. Move all consoles and communications equipment into the rear engine room.
    2. Remove the tables and chair from the front room and replace with reinforced walls.

> *A light communard gunship with dual slugthrowers - often used as escort vessels for larger battleships.*


## Armaments

* 2x SHI Slugthrowers


## Modules

* Module A: Reinforce Bridge 
* Module B: Open Slugthrower Boltholes 
* Module C: Fire Slugthrowers 
* Module D: Slugthrower Safeties On 
* Module E: Slugthrower Safeties Off


## Notes

Consider relocating the frontal cockpit and adding additional armor. Load EMP rounds into one slugthrower to immobilize your targets. The Vanguard is capable of solo operation but can benefit from a dedicated loader for prolonged or high-intensity engagements.

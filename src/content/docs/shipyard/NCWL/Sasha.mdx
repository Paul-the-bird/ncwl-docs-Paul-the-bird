    > *A converted assault cruiser, the Sasha is an experimental hull design first used as armed haulers in Chengridz, and later on as self-sufficient long-distance patrol vessels in Taypan. Although lacking in armor, the Sasha more than makes up for her thin skin with both destructive broadside cannons, and front-facing slugthrowers and artilleries. Comes with an expansive cargo hold and industrial modules, as well as an experimental FTL drive capable of planetary landings.*

    > *An improvement on the otherwise sluggish and underarmed Vanguard gunboat, the Vanguard Mk. II is a fresher design to come out of the Union's conceptual labs. Ripping the bridge out and relocating it in the engine room, the Vanguard gains extra space for a torpedo bay, while its outdated slugthrowers are replaced with more modern Vulcans. The upgraded powergrid has enough room left over for a light machine gun turret at the tail and a gyroscope with a new electronics refit, allowing for better combat performance.*

The Vanguard Mk2 is a significant upgrade to the original Vanguard, enhancing its overall design and providing it with superior medium-range offensive capabilities. Equipped with twin Vulcan turrets, the Mk2 delivers rapid and concentrated damage to specific hull sections, allowing it to efficiently dismantle enemy vessel turrets and hardpoints.

The Vanguard Mk2 excels at clearing the battlefield of damaged ships and personal by and exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed or poorly defended vessels, especially when enemy crew members are visible and unprotected.

The Mark 2's offensive arsenal is further strengthened by the addition of Idna heat-seeking missile pods. These missiles activate their targeting systems after traveling 50 meters. Once active, they utilize a 180-degree vision cone to detect and lock onto the first target within a 750-meter range. Upon locking, the missile homes in on the target and explodes shattering   even the strongest of hull plating

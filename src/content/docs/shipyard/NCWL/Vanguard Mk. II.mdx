    > *An improvement on the otherwise sluggish and underarmed Vanguard gunboat, the Vanguard Mk. II is a fresher design to come out of the Union's conceptual labs. Ripping the bridge out and relocating it in the engine room, the Vanguard gains extra space for a torpedo bay, while its outdated slugthrowers are replaced with more modern Vulcans. The upgraded powergrid has enough room left over for a light machine gun turret at the tail and a gyroscope with a new electronics refit, allowing for better combat performance.*

Targeting: Focus on disabling enemy turrets, hardpoints, and other critical systems. area saturation  are most effective for softening up targets before moving in for the kill.

Idna Heat-Seeking Missile Pods:
Missile Activation The missile’s tracking system arms after traveling 50 meters.
Once armed, the missile’s targeting system activates, using a 180-degree vision cone to detect the first enemy within a 750-meter range.
Upon locking onto a target, the missile homes in with high precision, capable of penetrating and destroying  even the most resilient hull plating.

Primary Targets: 
Prioritize ships with exposed or poorly defended areas. Focus on disabling enemy turrets and hardpoints to neutralize their threat.
 Once critical systems are disabled, switch to targeting vulnerable hull sections or exposed crew members to maximize damage and finish the job.

Initial Attack:
  Begin by firing on the general area you intend to destroy. Use the Q and R keys to rotate your guns while moving towards your target, maximizing coverage and damage output.
 Angle the ship’s nose downwards to align your shots with critical systems, ensuring concentrated fire on the most vital areas of the enemy ship.

 Once within missile kill range, release the Idna missiles to deliver the final blow, ensuring the target is completely neutralized.
 After launching the missiles, disengage from the immediate area and prepare for strafing or bombing runs if additional targets remain.

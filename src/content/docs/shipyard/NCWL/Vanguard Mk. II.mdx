> *An improvement on the otherwise sluggish and underarmed Vanguard gunboat, the Vanguard Mk. II is a fresher design to come out of the Union's conceptual labs. Ripping the bridge out and relocating it in the engine room, the Vanguard gains extra space for a torpedo bay, while it's outdated slugthrowers are replaced with more modern Vulcans. The upgraded powergrid has enough room left over for a light machine gun turret at the tail and a gyroscope with a new electronics refit, allowing for better combat performance.*

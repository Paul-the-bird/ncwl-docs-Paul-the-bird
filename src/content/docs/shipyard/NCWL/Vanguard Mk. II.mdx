import ShipCost from '@components/ShipCost.astro';


> *An improvement on the otherwise sluggish and underarmed Vanguard gunboat, the Vanguard Mk. II is a fresher design to come out of the Union's conceptual labs. Ripping the bridge out and relocating it in the engine room, the Vanguard gains extra space for a torpedo bay, while its outdated slugthrowers are replaced with more modern Vulcans. The upgraded powergrid has enough room left over for a light machine gun turret at the tail and a gyroscope with a new electronics refit, allowing for better combat performance.*


## Armaments

* 2x NT 20mm 'Vulcan' gatling 
* 1x SHI 180mm 'Idna' light torpedo pod 
* 1x 'Gran Sudaruska' point defense light machine gun


## Modules

* Module A: Fire Gatlings 
* Module B: Fire Torpedo 
* Module C: Open weapon boltholes 
* Module D: Gatling safeties on 
* Module E: Gatling safeties off


## Notes

The Vulcan gatlings are less capable of penetrating hull than the original Vanguard's slugthrowers, but can be useful for disabling external components and turrets. The torpedoes, on the other hand, will inflict severe damage upon impact and come with limited target-seeking capabilities. Quickly disengage after launching your torpedoes to give yourself time to re-arm and prepare for another strafing run.

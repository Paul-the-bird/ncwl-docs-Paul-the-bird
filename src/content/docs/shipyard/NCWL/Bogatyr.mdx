> *An outdated Imperial scouting gunship converted into a stealth bomber - the Bogatyr invests heavily into ballistics; with two SHI slugthrowers and four missile racks. Implemented with a fortified 'combat' mode and IFF cloaker, the Bogatyr sees frequent use in many communard naval operations today.*


## Armaments

* Hardpoint
  * 2x SHI Slugthrower 
  * 2x NT Sumitomo Missile Rack

## Modules

* Module A: Fire Slugthrowers 
* Module B: Slugthrower Safeties 
* Module C: Toggle Missile Boltholes 
* Module D: Fire Missiles 
* Module E: Reinforce Bridge


## Notes

Use the slugthrowers to weaken enemy ships before following up with missiles to completely disable or destroy them. Load EMP munitions into at least one slugthrower and one missile rack in order to immobilize your targets. You may benefit from a dedicated loader but the Bogatyr is capable of solo operation.

The Bogatyr's stealth capabilities include IFF cloaking and a radio jammer capable of disabling all radio communications within 500m (including your own).

# NCWL Docs

WIP.

## Contributing

All content should be located in [src/content/docs](src/content/docs). ([Starlight Doc](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/))

Use existing entries as a template for new entries.

Modify the `sidebar` key in [astro.config.mjs](astro.config.mjs) if adding a new section or document that should appear in the sidebar. ([Starlight Doc](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#add-links-and-link-groups))

## Framework

Built using [Astro](https://astro.build/)'s [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme.
